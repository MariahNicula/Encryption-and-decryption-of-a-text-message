ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION OF A TEXT MESSAGE

The app was created in Python , which offers users a secure and
user-friendly platform for encrypting and decrypting text messages
with ease. Using cryptographic algorithms such as RSA (Rivest-
Shamir-Adleman) , the application encrypts the provided text
message. For decrypting messages, the application requires the
appropriate decryption key.
